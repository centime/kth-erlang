Here are some assignments and reports from the Distributed Systems class at kth (Stockholm)

All is in erlang, a langage I had never used before. I'll just let this stuff hang there, because why not.

rudy
    webserver

routy
    router

loggy
    logging service

chordy
    distributed hash table
